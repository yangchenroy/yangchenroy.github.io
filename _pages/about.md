I am a linguist fascinated by sentence structure and meaning and how these are generated in the human mind-brain, particularly in the mind-brain of infants and children. I look at what children's journey towards adult language tells us about the uniquely human capacity for language and its intersection with general cognitive capacities. I am also interested in how the linguist's understanding of the way children learn language structure in their early years can be harnessed to build language tools and games for the elementary language classroom. The documentation and archiving of lesser-known and endangered languages is another area of language studies that I am deeply passionate about. The languages I usually draw insights from are ones spoken in a very linguistically diverse part of the world â€” the South Asian subcontinent. Most are either undocumented, or underrepresented in experimental and applied linguistics.

I am also an advocate for the rights of research students and early career researchers, supporting fair and timely wage disbursal, conducive research and work environments, and access to free healthcare, particularly mental healthcare. 

This website will eventually have a collection of Creative Commons licensed experimental material for collecting child language data from South Asian languages, games for low-resource elementary language classrooms, and a couple of my squibs, articles and book reviews.
