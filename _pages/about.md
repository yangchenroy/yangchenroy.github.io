I am a linguist fascinated by sentence structure and meaning and how these are generated in the human mind-brain, particularly in the mind-brain of infants and children. I study what children’s journey toward adult language tells us about the uniquely human capacity for language and its intersection with general cognitive mechanisms. I am also interested in how child language research can be harnessed to build language tools and games for elementary and adult language classrooms of multilinguals. I also work on the documentation and archiving of lesser-known, endangered, and under-resourced languages. The languages I usually draw insights from are ones spoken in a highly linguistically diverse part of the world — the South Asian subcontinent. Most are either undocumented or underrepresented in experimental and applied linguistics.

I am also an advocate for the rights of early career researchers, supporting fair and timely wage disbursal, conducive research and work environments, and access to affordable healthcare, particularly mental healthcare.
